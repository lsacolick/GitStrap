# GitStrap page configuration file.
This configuration file `Config` is used for this demo. Its written in Markdown
and parses the blockquotes (lines beginning with '`>`') for actual
configuration options.

## Site Title
This title will show up on the left side of the navigation bar and on the
browser tab.

    Example: >My Favorite Website

This setup uses the following:

```
>GitStrap
```

<a name="pagesandnav"></a>
## Pages / Navigation
List your pages below in the order in which you'd like them to show up on your
website's navigation bar. Make sure each item is separated by a space. These
pages must reflect an actual filename in the root/base directory, you can start
by editing these files or adding new ones -remember the filename is the same as
what shows up on the navigation tab.

    Example: >Home Contacts About

Use the keyword 'GSBLOG' to place the link for a blog index.

    Example: >Home Contacts GSBLOG About 

This setup uses the following:

```
>Readme.md Config Header Footer Example GSBLOG
```

## Theme
Put the theme name or url from [bootswatch](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/).

    Examples: >cerulean, >cosmo, >cyborg, >darkly, >flatly, >journal, >lumen,
        >paper, >readable, >sandstone, >simplex, >slate, >spacelab, >superhero,
        >united, and >yeti.

This setup uses the following:

```
>journal
```

## Header
A running header text can be specified in a file, if desired.  To turn off the
header text set this option to false.
    
    Example: >false

This setup uses the following:

```
>Header
```

## Footer
A running footer for each page.

    Example: >false

This setup uses the following:

```
>Footer
```

## Blog
If a blog is desired, the post files (stored in `/posts/` directory) will be
included in the same way as navigation items.  Include the desired blog entires
by adding them to the list.  If a blog is not required, set the option to
`false`.

    Example: >false

The blog index link is named by the first element in the post list:

    Example: >Index post1 post2 post3 post4

This setup uses the following:
```
>Blog Using-The-Blog GitStrap-Dependencies The-Index-File
```
